This is the repository for my personal web site.

For more information about the page, see [[https://elektrubadur.se/about_page/][About This Page]] on the web site.

* Branches

- [[https://github.com/bkhl/elektrubadur.se/tree/main][main]] :: the main branch that the web site is built from.
- [[https://github.com/bkhl/elektrubadur.se/tree/public][public]] :: the rendered web site is pushed to this branch. Because [[https://www.statichost.eu/][Statichost.eu]] will pull the web site from the default Git branch, this branch is set as the default branch.
