/Nära/ ("Near") is a series of close-up portraits of friends. They have
all been made with my /ЛОМО T-43 40mm f/4 lens/ --- a surprisingly high
quality glass triplet lens. They have also all been made at the same
distance and depth of focus, in the 2:3 format of the /Smena 8m/ camera
the lens was original made for, with no cropping.
