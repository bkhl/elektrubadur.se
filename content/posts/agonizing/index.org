I just acquired a /ЛОМО Т-43 40 mm f/4/ lens. It's a very nice glass
lens from the /Leningradskoe Optiko Mechanichesckoe Objedinenie/. Sadly,
the farthest I can focus it on my SLR without colliding with the mirror
is a couple of decimeters, giving this field of view. This self-portrait
is the start of a project I plan to undertake with this very limited
setup. More on that later.
