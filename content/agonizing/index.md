{{ snapshot(path="agonizing/agonizing.jpeg" description="Agonizing")}}

I just acquired a _ЛОМО Т-43 40 mm f/4_ lens. It's a very nice glass lens from the _Leningradskoe Optiko Mechanichesckoe Objedinenie_. Sadly, the farthest I can focus it on my SLR without colliding with the mirror is a couple of decimeters, giving this field of view. This self-portrait is the start of a project I plan to undertake with this very limited setup. More on that later.
