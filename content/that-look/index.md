This is an update on my ongoing project of close-up portraits made with my _ЛОМО Т-43 40 mm f/4_ lens, [mentioned here](./agonizing/index.md). I have a fair collection of portraits by now, I few of which are good enough to probably make the final series. This might be my favourite so far. Watch this space.
