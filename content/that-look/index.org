This is an update on my ongoing project of close-up portraits made with my /ЛОМО Т-43 40 mm f/4/ lens, [[file:/agonizing/][mentioned here]]. I have a fair collection of portraits by now, I few of which are good enough to probably make the final series. This might be my favourite so far. Watch this space.
