I am Björn Lindström, professional systems engineer and amateur photographer living in Bangkok. I used to live in Uppsala, Sweden. If you wish to contact me, send an e-mail to <bkhl@elektrubadur.se>.

Elektrubadur is a name I've used for various projects in the past, including [a band](https://www.jamendo.com/artist/4363/elektrubadur) and [a podcast](https://archive.org/details/ElektrubadurPodcast).
